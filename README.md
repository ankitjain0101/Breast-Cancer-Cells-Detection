# Breast-Cancer-Cells-Detection

The data was obtained from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The aims is to observe which features are most helpful to classify whether the breast cancer is benign or malignant.
Performed data exploration, and visualization like ggplot2, to analysis cells features like area mean, smoothness, symmetry  
After applying the different classification models, I have achieved an estimated accuracy of-
KNN- 93%
Random Forest- 94% 
Gradient Boosting model- 97%
